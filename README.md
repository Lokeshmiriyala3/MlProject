Project Overview:
This project aims to predict income levels using a dataset containing demographic and socioeconomic attributes. By employing various machine learning algorithms, we aim to build accurate models that can classify individuals into income categories.

Dataset
Source: The Adult Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Description: Contains features such as age, occupation, education level, marital status, and more, relevant for income prediction.
